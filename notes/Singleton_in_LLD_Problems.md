## Potential Issues with Extensive Singleton Usage:
- **Global State and Testing**: Singletons introduce global state into your application, which can make testing difficult. Mocking singletons in unit tests is more complicated than using dependency injection.
- **Tight Coupling**: Excessive use of singletons can lead to tight coupling between classes, making the code harder to maintain and extend.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Singletons must be carefully implemented to be thread-safe, which can add complexity.

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern:
#### Stateless Services:
Use Singletons for services that do not maintain any state between calls or do not require different configurations for different clients.
A logging service that is stateless and provides consistent logging across the application can benefit from a Singleton.
**Example**: A logging service or a configuration manager.

#### Resource-Intensive Objects:
Use Singletons for objects that are expensive to create and consume significant system resources.
Managing a limited resource, like a database connection pool, where the resource's lifecycle needs to be controlled and shared.
**Example**: Database connection pools.

#### Global Points of Access:
Use Singletons for classes that need to provide a global point of access.
Centralized configuration settings that are read-only or rarely change can be managed via Singletons.
Example: A cache manager or a configuration reader.

## When to Avoid the Singleton Pattern:
#### Testability:
Avoid Singletons for classes that need to be easily mocked or replaced in tests. Singletons can make unit testing more difficult because they introduce global state.

#### Thread Safety:
Be cautious with Singletons that maintain mutable state, as they can lead to concurrency issues. Implementing thread-safe Singletons can add complexity.

#### Flexibility:
Avoid Singletons for classes that might need different configurations or instances in the future. Singletons limit flexibility and make it harder to adapt to changing requirements.

## Singleton Pattern Common Use cases in LLD Problems

#### Logging Service
**Use Case**: Provides a centralized logging mechanism for the application.
**Example**: A logging utility that ensures all parts of the application log messages in a consistent format.
